## I was born on Earth, but I don’t know if I’ll ever see it again.

My name doesn’t matter much out here. I am a lone explorer, a seeker of worlds, a traveler between stars. I left home long ago—how long, I’m not even sure anymore. Time bends in space, and while I have aged slowly, the Earth I knew has spun forward without me.

My mission is simple, but its weight is immeasurable: **Find a new home for humanity.** A place where we can start again, where soil will take root, where skies will shelter us. I have crossed light-years in search of such a world, charting the unknown, stepping onto planets untouched by human hands, breathing air that no one else has ever inhaled.

I am alone, but I am not lost. Each distant sunrise reminds me why I keep going. I send these logs out into the void, hoping that someone, somewhere, is listening. Maybe you’re out there. Maybe you’re still waiting.
