## A New Earth, Somewhere
## Date: Mission Day 12,904
## Location: Edge of the Trappist Expanse

There is a star ahead of me, burning steady against the void. Seven planets dance in its light, their orbits precise, their surfaces unknown. I’ve been searching for a long time—longer than a single human lifetime should allow—but I am still here, still moving forward. Because I have to be.
Earth is dying. Maybe it already has. I don’t know. I stopped receiving transmissions from home a while ago. A system failure? A shift in frequency? Or something worse?
I try not to think about it.
Instead, I focus on my mission.
Find a new home. A place where human hands can touch soil and feel warmth, where children can run under a sky that isn’t filled with toxic storms or artificial domes. A world that can hold the weight of our survival.
I run a scan of the third planet. It looks promising—oxygen-rich, liquid water, stable temperatures. I won’t know for sure until I set foot on its surface. My hands shake as I enter the landing sequence. Excitement. Fear. Hope.
Hope.
It’s what keeps me pressing forward, what makes me stare into the abyss of space and see more than darkness. Somewhere out here, there has to be a second chance for us. For humanity.
Maybe it’s waiting for me down there.
Maybe, just maybe, I’m about to step onto humanity’s new home.
I’ll find out soon.
And if I do… I hope someone is still out there to hear the news.
