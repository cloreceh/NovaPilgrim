## Footsteps on Another World
## Date: Mission Day 12,907
## Location: Surface of Eos-3

I stepped out onto the soil today.
It was firmer than I expected, a mix of compacted earth and fine dust, kicking up in slow-motion plumes as I walked. Gravity here is lighter than Earth’s, but not by much. My boots left imprints—clear, sharp. The first human footprints on this world. Maybe the first life to touch this ground at all.
Eos-3. That’s what I’m calling it. A sunrise planet, orbiting its star in the habitable zone, cradling the possibility of a future.
The air is thin but breathable. I ran every test twice before taking off my helmet. My heart pounded as I cracked the seal, half expecting to choke on unseen toxins or collapse from some unknown atmospheric anomaly. But instead, I breathed. The air was sharp and cold, tinged with something metallic, but it filled my lungs. It filled me with something else, too.
Awe.
It’s been so long since I’ve stood under an open sky. The sky here is a deep violet at midday, streaked with clouds that glow faintly in the upper atmosphere. I can see mountains in the distance, jagged and red, and beyond them, something shimmering on the horizon—water, maybe? If there’s water, there’s hope.
I set up a temporary base near a small outcrop. My instruments are running, scanning for microbial life, for stable climate patterns, for anything that would make this world viable for human settlement.
I want to believe I’ve found it. The place we’ve been searching for. A second Earth.
I sit outside my lander as the sun sets, watching the sky shift through colors I have no names for. The loneliness is still there, a constant companion, but tonight, it feels different. Not as heavy.
Because for the first time in years, I don’t just feel like I’m wandering.
I feel like I’ve arrived.
